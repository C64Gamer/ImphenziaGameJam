 We are a growing community of game creators around Imphenzia's YT channel with all kind of experience levels in game development. We had the idea to create one big game with our community to improve our skills.
 Everyone is able to take over tasks. No time pressure no deadlines. You wanna join this journey? Visit us on our Discord server found here:

## Getting Started

Getting started is quiet easy. Install the mentioned Unity3D version in the next section below join our discord and say hello to the community.
Checkout this project and open it with Unity3D. It could take a while to import all the assets etc. After this is done you are nearly ready to go.
The last step is do choose a role in our project. This role decides also what additional tools you have to install.

Roles: 
- Coder
- 3D Artist
- Sound Engineer
- Game Designer
 
 **If problems are popping up don't be shy to ask for help in the community**
 
 We decided to use Trello as task management system to organize ourselves a bit better. Link to the task board can be found on our discord.

 Cheers & have fun :-)
